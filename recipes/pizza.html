        <ul> <strong> Ingredients</strong>
            <li>1 pound of prepared pizza dough</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1/3 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 teasppon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 ounces of mozarella</li>
            <li>3 prosciutto slices torn </li>
            <li>2 large basil leaves torn</li>
        </ul>
        <ol> <strong> Steps</strong>
            <li>Preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Shape pizza dough into an 8 to 10-inch disc. Brush dough with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Reduce the flame on half the grill burners to Low, to create areas of direct and indirect heat.</li>
            <li>Carefully place dough onto the grill over direct heat. Close the cover. Grill dough until bottom is just barely cooked and shows char marks, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn crust ninety degrees (do not flip dough over). Grill until crust shows light grill marks, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove par-grilled dough from the grill. Spread ricotta over dough; sprinkle with salt and Italian seasoning. Place cheese on top, add prosciutto evenly over cheese.</li>
            <li>Return pizza to the grill over indirect heat; grill until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Carefully remove pizza from the grill.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Broil pizza until cheese is golden, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle torn basil on top of pizza. Allow pizza to rest for a few minutes before cutting into wedges.</li>
